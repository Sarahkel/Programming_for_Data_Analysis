    "**NumPy** is a core package of the Python-based ecosystem of open-source software **SciPy**. NumPy is a library that enables users to work efficiently with arrays by providing handy features to define arrays and in-built fast math functions that operate on the array. *[1]* In this notebook, we will have a closer look at the **numpy.random** package of NumPy, which allows users to generate pseudorandom numbers.\n",
