    "**NumPy** is a core package of the Python-based ecosystem of open-source software **SciPy**. NumPy is a library that enables users to work efficiently with arrays by providing handy features to define arrays and in-built fast math functions that operate on the array. *[1]* In this notebook, we will have a closer look at the **numpy.random** package of NumPy, which allows users to generate pseudorandom numbers.\n",

    "It has to be kept in mind that despite its name, numpy.random cannot generate truly random numbers, but pseudorandom numbers. Ronald T. Kneusel reminds the reader that John von Neumann had already established that \"there is no such thing as a random number - there are only methods to produce random numbers\" *[2, p.12]* and offers a definition: \n",
