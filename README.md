# Programming_for_Data_Analysis
Project for Programming_for_Data_Analysis Module 2018

## Problem Statement
Create a Jupyter notebook explaining the use of the numpy.random package, including detailed explanations of at least five of the distributions provided for in the package.

There are four distinct tasks to be carried out in your Jupyter notebook.
1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.
2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.
3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

## How to run the notebook

Please find the project [here](https://github.com/Sarahkel/Programming_for_Data_Analysis/blob/master/Project.ipynb) under "Project.ipynb" and run from top to bottom. As all the package imports are done in the first cell of code it is crucial to have this run. Also, it is possible that cells built on variables defined in previous code cells.

References can be found at the end of each section and are marked [n].

For any question, please feel free to contact me.
